## Roadmap

As the mod is really early, there is still stuff to look into.

[] Balancing Level 1 to 2 of the first 3 weapons
[] Add Level 2 upgrades
[] Add Level 3 weapons
[] Add Level 3 Upgrades
[] Add Assault Rifle (Medium range with burst of bullets)
[] Add Sniper Rifle (Long range with high damage, but slow)
[] First draw on caracter class
[] First draw on archetype

The goal is to have different classes that we can mix. As we get advance in those classes and multiclass, we unlock new archetype which will give access to legendary weapons.
Let's say you need level 2 pistol + level 1 caracterA to now been able to draw legendaryWeaponX, but level 3 pistol and level 2 caracterB would allow legendaryWeaponY.
